Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Stil remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow sreets of cobblestone
Neath the halo of the a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes was stabbed by the flash of the neon light
it split the night
and touched the sound of silence
